# Many-Worlds Comic Strip

- Circuit: Create a branching structure across registers. Each measurement produces a “panel” of a comic strip—characters (qubit groups) collapse differently each time.
- Art Output: A comic where each run is a different universe of the same story.
- Philosophy: Narrative as many-worlds—every telling collapses differently.
